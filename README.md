**Description**  

**üá∫üá≤Ô∏è ENGLISH**  
    This package is a Java program with a low memory footprint, intended to be used as a small data integrator, 
    more commonly known as an ETL (Extract Transform Load) tool, which can be useful for setting up 
    a lightweight ETL project. Its objective is to be as simple as possible to configure and to retain the 
    power of a quality ETL service for the relational database ecosystem.
    Its ambition in this area is to be as complete as possible.

## Construct a job  

### General informations    

**What can we do ?**  

 IsiETL is based on reading a job description file. This description file must be written in YAML format and given any name you like (note that the default name for this file is integrator.yml if you want it to be automatically found by the current Job Runner).  
You must therefore start by building a job file in Yaml. To do this, you can use IsiETL and its option (`-jt` / `--jobstemplate`),this option allows you to generate a template file in your application's local folder for running an IsiETL job. All you have to do is fill it in correctly with values ‚Äã‚Äãrepresenting your file and database elements.  

*What can we do with IsiETl?*  

- Extract data from a database and save it to a file (CSV format for now).  
- Securely import data from a file into a database (Postgresql for now).  
- Check the file format and consistency before integration (to minimize error-related shutdowns during integration).  
- Enable controlled integration by avoiding duplicates.  
- Conversely, you can also integrate your data without duplicate checks.  
- Control integration via batch mode into your database, which speeds up integration times.  
- Have control, automatically and securely create the dump table schema in your database.  
- Execute pre- and post-integration actions.  
- Filtering action, which allows you to not integrate data if it does not match a set of filter criteria.  
- Mapping action, allowing you to mix and concatenate your input data to the output.  
- Transformation action, allowing you to transform your values ‚Äã‚Äãbefore integration.  
- Post-processing action, allowing you to run queries on the table after integration is complete (raw SQL is supported and allows DML actions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

### Create a job file  

Ideally, to create a job, you should use a template file dedicated to this activity and with the variable names correctly predefined.  

You can obtain this template file by running IsiETL with the `-jt` option or the long `--jobtemplate` option. This dumps a YAML-formatted template file named `integrator_template.yml` into your program's local folder.  

_Below is what the template file contains_

And now you can adjust your settings.  

üëâÔ∏èLet's go there to list these different blocks of variables.üëàÔ∏è  

**_Les variables d'ent√™tes_**  
`jobName: "just an explicit name to describe the job"`  
The joBName variable expects a string that allows you to give a name to the job. This variable is not used in the job, but is mandatory.  

`jobDescription: "Get data from a CSV file to a DB postgresql"`   
The jobDescription variable expects a long description of your job.

`jobDateTime: "2025-05-20 12:00:00"`  
The JobDate variable allows you to date your job. Here again, this variable is there for information purposes to force you to date your job.  

`jobBatchSize: "200"`  
The jobBatchSize variable allows you to adjust the number of insert/update rows supported in batch mode. Batch mode allows you to be more efficient in writing data to your database by reducing the number of time-consuming disk writes. It is important to choose this variable carefully. You must have a size greater than 0. If you want to monitor the integration in real time, you can use a low value [1-15], the higher the value the more you will gain in speed, but the commits will be spaced out, therefore potentially a loss of data in the event of a crash.  

`forceIntermediateCommit: "true"`  
The forceIntermediateCommit variable is coupled with the jobBatchSize variable, which can be set to true or false. If the value is true, a commit is performed every "jobBatchSize" number of lines. If you specify false for this variable, only a commit at the end of the integration is performed, which will allow you to exploit the integrated data.

**How to run?**  

- To be able to start a job, it is necessary that you have built it in the form of a YAML file, as mentioned above. You can either specify the full or relative path of this Job file to be executed on the command line when launching the application.  
- isiETL also offers an option to display the parameters on the execution console of your YAML 'Job' file read.   
- As well as an option to display online help.  
 
**CLI parameters, isietl.properties and d√©fault parameters**  

The execution options are read in the following order:  

1. Parameters passed on the CLI.  
2. Parameters from the isietl.properties file which must be located in the same folder as your executable.  
3. default parameters of the program, the job file located in the executable folder, which must be named by default integration.yml and has a value of displayparameter.

**CLI usage :**  
type option `--help` or `-h` to get help from CLI.
